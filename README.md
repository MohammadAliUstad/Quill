## Overview

Quill is an evolving digital sanctuary for readers. In a world of cluttered interfaces and subscription walls, Quill aims to get back to basics: just you and the text.

Currently focused on delivering a robust ePub rendering engine and a distraction-free UI, the project is establishing the foundation for a modern, privacy-focused reading ecosystem. Whether you are catching up on a novel or organizing your digital library, Quill provides a clean, adaptive environment that grows with your reading habits.

- **Typography Control:** Customize your experience with 6 curated font options and adjustable text sizing.

### Personalization & Privacy
